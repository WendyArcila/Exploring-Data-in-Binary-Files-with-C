# Exploring Data in Binary Files with C
This C program is designed to read and analyze data in binary files, providing various results based on predefined input scenarios.

## Binary File Structure:
The binary file follows a specific structure with a header that provides information about the lengths of the three sections: Students, Courses, and Enrollments. Three programs are implemented with different objectives:

1. In the first exercise, a program is developed to read the binary file, which prints all students' names, ages, and genders within an age range. The age limits are provided as command-line arguments.

2. The second exercise implements a program to calculate the average ages of students attending a specific course.

3. Lastly, in the third exercise, a program is developed to print the number of distinct students who enrolled in at least one class per semester, divided by gender and student type (graduate, undergraduate).
